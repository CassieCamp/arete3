## Key Design Principles Captured

### 1. Human-Centered Language
- "Destinations" instead of "Goals"
- "Three Big Ideas" instead of "Goal List"
- "Fresh Thoughts" for personal reflections
- "Journey" for timeline visualization

### 2. Unified Entry System
- Single interface for both session transcripts and fresh thoughts
- AI-powered title generation and goal detection
- Context-aware insights based on entry type

### 3. Freemium Model
- 3 free entries for non-coached users
- Feature gating with upgrade prompts
- Coach request system for conversion

### 4. Progressive Disclosure
- Simple navigation with powerful features underneath
- Tooltip system for first-time users
- Contextual AI assistance

## Technical Architecture Highlights

### Database Schema Changes
```
session_insights ‚Üí entries (with entry_type field)
goals ‚Üí destinations (with Three Big Ideas support)

New Collections:
- quotes (inspirational quote system)
- user_quote_likes (personalization)
- small_steps (AI-derived intentions)
- coach_resources (resource library)
- coach_client_notes (client-specific content)
```

### API Endpoint Structure
```
/api/v1/entries (unified entry system)
/api/v1/destinations (renamed from goals)
/api/v1/quotes (quote management)
/api/v1/basecamp (identity foundation)
/api/v1/coach (coach dashboard and features)
/api/v1/freemium (upgrade and gating)
```

### Component Architecture
```
Core Layout: MainLandingPage, QuoteCarousel, BottomNavigation
Entry System: UnifiedEntryModal, SessionEntryForm, FreshThoughtEntryForm
Mountain Section: MountainTabNavigation, BasecampTab, JourneyTab, DestinationsTab
Coach Features: CoachDashboard, ClientManagement, ResourceLibrary
Freemium: FreemiumGate, UpgradePrompts, CoachRequestModal
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Sprint S10.1)
**Critical Path**: Database migration must be completed first
- All subsequent sprints depend on the new schema
- Includes rollback procedures and backward compatibility
- Establishes new backend services and API endpoints

### Phase 2: User Experience (Sprints S10.2-S10.4)
**Parallel Development Possible**: After foundation is complete
- Landing page and quote system (S10.2)
- Entry system (S10.3) 
- Mountain navigation (S10.4)

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Sprint S10.5)
**Enhancement Phase**: Coach features and freemium completion
- Can be developed in parallel with Phase 2
- Focuses on monetization and coach experience

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success
- [ ] Zero data loss during migration
- [ ] All existing functionality maintained
- [ ] New features working as specified
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved

### User Experience Success
- [ ] Reduced time to create entries
- [ ] Increased engagement with destinations
- [ ] Positive feedback on new navigation
- [ ] Successful first-time user onboarding

### Business Success
- [ ] Freemium to coached conversion rate tracking
- [ ] Entry creation frequency increase
- [ ] Coach resource utilization
- [ ] User retention improvement

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Migration Risks
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing in staging, rollback procedures
- **Monitoring**: Data integrity validation, performance metrics

### User Experience Risks
- **Mitigation**: A/B testing, gradual feature rollout with flags
- **Monitoring**: User feedback collection, usage analytics

### Technical Risks
- **Mitigation**: Backward compatibility, feature flags
- **Monitoring**: Error tracking, performance monitoring

## Context Preservation
