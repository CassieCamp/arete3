# Arete MVP Documentation

This directory contains all project documentation organized by category.

## Sprint Plans

### Active Plans
- [`../sprint_plan.md`](../sprint_plan.md) - Main comprehensive sprint plan (all sprints overview)
- [`../sprint_s3_plan.md`](../sprint_s3_plan.md) - Current Sprint S3 consolidated plan (Organizations & Invitations)

### Historical Sprint Plans
Located in [`sprints/`](sprints/):

#### Sprint S3 Evolution
- [`sprint_s3_original.md`](sprints/sprint_s3_original.md) - Original comprehensive plan with custom database models
- [`sprint_s3_optimized.md`](sprints/sprint_s3_optimized.md) - Optimized version leveraging Clerk's native features (90%+ Clerk utilization)
- [`sprint_s3_detailed_implementation.md`](sprints/sprint_s3_detailed_implementation.md) - Detailed implementation focusing on custom invitations

#### Other Sprints
- [`sprint_s4_plan.md`](sprints/sprint_s4_plan.md) - Sprint S4: Core Coaching Loop (Session Management)

## Organization Strategy

### Current Approach (Post-Consolidation)
- **Main Plans**: Keep active sprint plans in root for easy access
- **Historical Plans**: Archive in `docs/sprints/` with descriptive names
- **Consolidated Plans**: Replace multiple versions with single source of truth
- **Implementation-Based**: Plans reflect actual implemented code, not just design

### File Naming Convention
- `sprint_sX_plan.md` - Active/current sprint plan
- `sprint_sX_[descriptor].md` - Historical versions with descriptive names
- `sprint_sX_consolidated.md` - Consolidated version (becomes main plan)

## Key Changes Made

### Sprint S3 Consolidation
1. **Analyzed 3 different S3 plans** and actual implementation
2. **Used Optimized Plan as foundation** (90%+ Clerk utilization)
3. **Reflected actual code** in services and models
4. **Created single source of truth** for Sprint S3
5. **Archived historical versions** for reference

### Benefits
- ✅ **Eliminated Confusion**: Single Sprint S3 plan instead of 3 conflicting versions
- ✅ **Reflects Reality**: Plan matches actual implemented code
- ✅ **Organized Structure**: Clear separation of active vs historical plans
- ✅ **Reduced Complexity**: Leveraged Clerk's proven infrastructure
- ✅ **Maintained History**: All previous plans preserved for reference

## Next Steps

1. **Sprint S5 Planning**: Create Goal Discovery & Management plan
2. **Update Main Plan**: Reflect S3 completion and S4/S5 clarification
3. **Regular Consolidation**: Keep plans aligned with implementation
4. **Documentation**: Maintain this organization structure
