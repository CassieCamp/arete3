# Comprehensive Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… WebSocket Authentication Bug
**Problem**: `'Query' object is not subscriptable` error in WebSocket authentication
**Fix**: Updated `get_current_user_websocket` in `backend/app/api/v1/deps.py`
- Fixed user ID consistency (using backend user ID)
- Fixed WebSocket endpoint to accept connection properly

### 2. âœ… Onboarding Flow Integration
**Problem**: OnboardingGuide component existed but was never rendered
**Fix**: Integrated OnboardingGuide into dashboard layout
- Added `<OnboardingGuide />` to `frontend/src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`
- Fixed API endpoints to use correct backend URLs (`http://localhost:8000`)

### 3. âœ… API Endpoint Configuration
**Problem**: Frontend making API calls to wrong endpoints (404 errors)
**Fix**: Updated all onboarding API calls to use backend URL
- `fetchOnboardingState()` now calls `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/me/onboarding`
- `startOnboarding()` now calls `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/me/onboarding/start`
- `completeStep()` and `completeOnboarding()` updated similarly

## Current Status

### âœ… Working Features
1. **Onboarding API calls** - Backend logs show successful 200 responses
2. **User authentication** - Users are properly authenticated and found in database
3. **Onboarding state tracking** - `started_at` timestamps are being set
4. **WebSocket authentication** - Fixed the Query object error

### ðŸ”„ Expected Behavior Now
1. **New users** should see the onboarding modal when they visit the dashboard
2. **Existing users** with incomplete onboarding should see the modal
3. **WebSocket connections** should work without 403 errors
4. **Role-specific content** should display based on user role (coach vs client)

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Onboarding Flow**:
   - Sign in with a new user account
   - Navigate to `/dashboard`
   - Should see onboarding modal overlay
   - Complete onboarding steps
   - Modal should disappear when completed

2. **Test Role-Specific Content**:
   - Coach users should see coach-specific onboarding steps
   - Client users should see client-specific onboarding steps

3. **Test WebSocket**:
   - No more console errors about WebSocket connections
   - Notification system should work properly

## Root Cause Analysis

The issues were interconnected:
1. **Missing Integration**: OnboardingGuide was built but never integrated into the app
2. **Wrong API URLs**: Frontend was calling Next.js API routes instead of backend
3. **WebSocket Bug**: Authentication function had a type error
4. **No Error Handling**: Silent failures made debugging difficult

## Prevention Measures

1. **Integration Testing**: Always test end-to-end user flows
2. **API Configuration**: Use environment variables for API URLs
3. **Error Logging**: Add proper error handling and logging
4. **Component Integration**: Ensure new components are properly integrated into layouts
